# gpx_tools

A collection of tools for gps files. Mainly centered on .gpx files.
I use a lot of them to process data from garmin etrex device.


## Type conversion scripts (`<ext>_to_<ext>.sh`).

These are for mass conversion of files between types. And includes a workaround for gpsbabel, which can not handle all types of file names (ex. greek utf-8).
